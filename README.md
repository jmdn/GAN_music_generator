# GAN_music_generator
GAN designed to generate "music". The network can take in any .mp3 file to use for training. Currently, the network is only built to generate 1 second clips of music. But this can be changed. 

Use the concatenator script to concatenate all the individual .mp3 outputs that are produced during GAN during training to produce a single .mp3 that plays what the generator is learning to produce as training progresses.
